There are a lot of paid solutions such as AnyDesk, TeamViewer, ZeroTier, etc. However, ideally, we want a self-hosted solution, so that we could run it indefinitely without heavy reliance on third party developers. There we could consider open source solutions like RustDesk &amp; RustDesk Server software, xrdp, freerdp, etc. Futhermore, we can consider software such as Guacamole. Unfortunately, all of the software has thair strong and not so strong sides. In fact, practically, I find Google Chrome Remote Desktop to be the easiest software to deal with, although, personally, I am not a big fun of it. Historically, Google Chrome Remote Desktop was the easiest to install, and when I came to my work, everyone would understand it. For example, I could say: \"Oh, just use Chrome Remote Desktop\", and my colleagues would get it without any further explanation. Convenient, isn't it.</p> <p>Anyhow, it is time to step forward, we are acquiring new equipment, and I am going to setup a complex system with ability to give remote access to our equipment on demand whenever and wherever I am situated. For this, I have continued my experiments with various remote-desktop-software, and, here, I will document some of my findings. Starting from RustDesk. First of all, I found that for self-hosting, we need to use a pair of programs, RustDesk as a client, and RustDesk Server as a server applications. I set the server application on an AWS EC2 instance, what was relatively easy. And, following guidelines I found on the internet, I shared the ID, Relay Server, and Key with the client app. It all seemed to be working on the first day, but, on the second day, it would fail to connect to the server on my Windows machine, but wouldn't fail on my Linux machine. Also, I had to use xrdp instead of built-in gnome remote desktop on Ubuntu 24.04 because it wouldn't work the way I want it to causing me black screens.</p> <p> </p> <p>Eventually, I stumbled upon Guacamole, following guidelines on the internet, I installed it natively on the Ubuntu 24.04. Notably, Ubuntu 24.04 doesn't provide Tomcat 9 because they moved forward to Tomcat 10. However, Guacamole doesn't like Tomcat 10, but it has not problems with Tomcat 9. To solve this problem, I had to download files directly from the Tomcat website. Luckily, installation was straight forward. The reason I didn't go with the version 10 was because Guacamole didn't support that version at that time. Not sure how it is like now. Furtermore, marrying Guacamole version 1.5.5 with gnome remote desktop was impossible. Apparently, there is a bug related with that version of Guacamole. Again, to solve this problem, I had to clone the official mirror repository of Guacamole on GitHub. After this, it seemed to be working, fingers crossed...</p> <p>To install Guacamole server-side service, start by installing dependencies:</p> <pre><code>sudo apt install build-essential libcairo2-dev libjpeg-turbo8-dev \\\n    libpng-dev libtool-bin libossp-uuid-dev libvncserver-dev \\\n    freerdp2-dev libssh2-1-dev libtelnet-dev libwebsockets-dev \\\n    libpulse-dev libvorbis-dev libwebp-dev libssl-dev \\\n    libpango1.0-dev libswscale-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev \\\n    libavformat-dev\n</code></pre> <p>Then, install server-side service.</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/apache/guacamole-server\ncd guacamole-server\nautoreconf -fi\nsudo ./configure --with-init-dir=/etc/init.d --enable-allow-freerdp-snapshots\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n</code></pre> <p>After installation of the service, I continued to configuring the service.</p> <pre><code>sudo ldconfig\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl start guacd\nsudo systemctl enable guacd\n</code></pre> <p>As a rule of thumb, I also checked the status of the service.</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl status guacd\n</code></pre> <p>This I just followed the guide as I had no problems with creating folders at this stage either.</p> <pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /etc/guacamole/{extensions,lib}\n</code></pre> <p>From now on, I focused on Tomcat 9.</p> <pre><code>sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk\nsudo useradd -m -U -d /opt/tomcat -s /bin/false tomcat\nsudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.96/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.96.tar.gz -P /tmp\nsudo tar -xvf /tmp/apache-tomcat-9.0.96.tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat\nsudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat\n</code></pre> <p>Tomcat is installed, we proceed to configure it.</p> <pre><code>cd /etc/systemd/system\nsudo nvim tomcat.service\n</code></pre> <p>Once I created the file, I paste in the following configuration.</p> <pre><code>[Unit]\nDescription=Tomcat Server\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=forking\nUser=tomcat\nGroup=tomcat\nEnvironment=\"JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64\"\nWorkingDirectory=/opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.96\nExecStart=/opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.96/bin/startup.sh\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n</code></pre> <p>Restarting services to let it pick up the changes won't hurt at this stage.</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl start tomcat\nsudo systemctl enable tomcat\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, if I access the service at port 8080, it should render a page saying all is working. Now, I can focus my attention on Guacamole Web App client.</p> <pre><code>sudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/guacamole/1.5.5/binary/guacamole-1.5.5.war\nsudo mv guacamole-1.5.5.war /opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-9.0.96/webapps/guacamole.war\nsudo systemctl restart tomcat guacd\n</code></pre> <p>This is a \"production-ready\" approach, so we use a database for user authentication instead of a simple XML-file as was documented in the official manual.</p> <pre><code>sudo apt install mariadb-server -y\nsudo mysql_secure_installation\n</code></pre> <p>As a note, I didn't use unix_sockets, but a regular password. The rest I left at default arguments. Next, the guide was suggesting to download an older version of a MySQL/J connector (v8.0.26), but I felt brave, and download the latest version 9.1.0. The download procedure was different for me for some reason. I had to manually download file from the website.</p> <pre><code>sudo apt install ./mysql-connector-j_9.1.0-1ubuntu24.04_all.deb\nsudo cp /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar /etc/guacamole/lib/\n</code></pre> <p>Next, I focused on the Apache Guacamole JDBC AUTH plugin.</p> <pre><code>sudo wget https://downloads.apache.org/guacamole/1.5.5/binary/guacamole-auth-jdbc-1.5.5.tar.gz\nsudo tar -xf guacamole-auth-jdbc-1.5.5.tar.gz\nsudo mv guacamole-auth-jdbc-1.5.5/mysql/guacamole-auth-jdbc-mysql-1.5.5.jar /etc/guacamole/extensions/\n</code></pre> <p>Now, it is time to configure our database.</p> <pre><code>sudo mysql -u root -p\n</code></pre> <p>These are the commands inside MariaDB.</p> <pre><code>MariaDB [(none)]&gt; CREATE DATABASE guac_db;\nMariaDB [(none)]&gt; CREATE USER 'guac_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\nMariaDB [(none)]&gt; GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON guac_db.* TO 'guac_user'@'localhost';\nMariaDB [(none)]&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\nMariaDB [(none)]&gt; EXIT;\n</code></pre> <p>After, we want to apply a schema.</p> <pre><code>cd guacamole-auth-jdbc-1.5.5/mysql/schema\ncat *.sql | mysql -u root -p guac_db\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we should tell Guacamole how it should handle user data. We create a simple properties file.</p> <pre><code>sudo nvim /etc/guacamole/guacamole.properties\n</code></pre> <p>And, populate it with the configuration below.</p> <pre><code># MySQL properties\nmysql-hostname: 127.0.0.1\nmysql-port: 3306\nmysql-database: guac_db\nmysql-username: guac_user\nmysql-password: password\n</code></pre> <p>Restart all relevant services.</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl restart tomcat guacd mysql\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the service should be accessible at port <code>8080/guacamole</code>, and default login and password should be <code>guacadmin</code>. At this point, it is strongly recommended to create a new admin user and password and delete the default credentials. To do this, from the guacadmin profile click on Settings. Under the Edit User section, enter your new username and password. Then, under the Permissions section check the all boxes. When you are done, click Save. Now log out from the default user and log in back to Apache Guacamole with your new user created. Then, navigate to the settings, and users tab, and delete the guacadmin user. That\u2019s it, you are done. From there, you can securely access your servers and computers.</p> <p>References:</p> <ul> <li>Guide to install Guacamole server program</li> <li>Guide to install Tomcat 9 on Ubuntu 24.04</li> <li>Here I found how to build Guacamole from GitHub repository</li> <li>This is the mirror repository of Apache Guacamole on GitHub</li> <li>The website where I download MySQL/J connector</li> </ul>"},{"location":"manual/#virtualisation","title":"Virtualisation","text":"<p>When working with VirtualBox, to enable bridge network, it is a simple matter of changing networking adapter in the settings of the progam to bridge adapter with the real ethernet adapter selected below. However, VirtualBox doesn't let us do hardware passthrough or, at least, I didn't find a definite answer to this on the internet. Otherwise, VirtualBox is a very useful piece of software that I use from time to time to experiment with various OS and new software.</p> <p>Moving to QEMU/KVM, to allow virtual machines to connect to outside world the host's network should be reconfigured. To install QEMU/KVM with Virtual Manager to the following:</p> <pre><code>sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils virt-manager\n</code></pre> <p>Usually, on Ubuntu 24.04.1, user is already part of <code>libvirt</code>, so we just need to add the user to the <code>kvm</code> group.</p> <pre><code>sudo adduser $USER kvm\n</code></pre> <p>Once the user is added to the groups, I would suggest rebooting. After reboot, we can check if the installation is correct by checking if there are any virtual machines on the system.</p> <pre><code>sudo virsh list --all\n</code></pre> <p>Or, we can check status of the <code>libvirt</code> daemon.</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl status libvirtd\n</code></pre> <p>Then, we can create bridge interface. Although, the default NAT allows VMs to communicate with the host and each other. And, through port forwarding on the host, we can expose the VMs to the outside world.</p> <pre><code>nmcli con show\nnmcli con add ifname br0 type bridge con-name br0\nnmcli con add type bridge-slave ifname eth0 master br0\nnmcli con mod br0 bridge.stp no\nnmcli con down eth0\nnmcli con up br0\nnmcli device show\nsudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service\n</code></pre> <p>Although, creating bridges seems to be the most logical approach, sometimes, we can't use them. Therefore, port forwarding seems to be a viable alternative. Here is how to forward ports from host physical interface to virtual interface where the guest VMs reside.</p> <pre><code>iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -d HOST_IP --dport HOST_PORT -j DNAT --to-destination GUEST_IP:GUEST_PORT\niptables -I FORWARD -m state -d GUEST_IP/24 --state NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n</code></pre> <p>For now, I am using <code>iptables-persistent</code> to save/reload port forwarding rules between reboots.</p> <pre><code>sudo apt install iptables-persistent\n</code></pre> <p>The location is saves the rules in is <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code>. To save the rules and load them, I use the following commands. I had to wrap it around as a command for a bash because I need elevated privilages on both piping as well as saving commands.</p> <pre><code>sudo bash -c \"iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4\"\n</code></pre> <p>To setup static IP inside guest VM, we need to modify the netplan configuration file for the NetworkManager service.</p> <pre><code>network:\n    version: 2\n    renderer: NetworkManager\n    ethernets:\n        INTERFACE_NAME:\n            dhcp4: false\n            addresses:\n                - STATIC_IP/24\n            routes:\n                - to: default\n                 via: HOST_IP\n            nameservers:\n                addresses: [HOST_IP]\n</code></pre> <p>For example, <code>INTERFACE_NAME=eth0</code>, <code>STATIC_IP=192.168.1.100</code>, <code>HOST_IP=192.168.1.1</code>. Save the aforementioned in the <code>/etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml</code> file. And, apply the plan.</p> <pre><code>sudo chmod 700 /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml\nsudo netplan try\n</code></pre> <p>Then, we setup KVM to allow guest VMs to use bridge interface. Start from creating a file in an arbitrary location on the computer and name it <code>host-birdge.xml</code>.</p> <pre><code>&lt;network&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;host-bridge&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;forward mode=\"bridge\"/&gt;\n    &lt;bridge name=\"br0\"/&gt;\n&lt;/network&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Then execute these commands (as a user in the libvirt group):</p> <pre><code>virsh net-define host-bridge.xml\nvirsh net-start host-bridge\nvirsh net-autostart host-bridge\n</code></pre> <p>A mechanism to allow connections from outside.</p> <pre><code>sudo modprobe br_netfilter\nsudo echo \"br_netfilter\" &gt; /etc/modules-load.d/br_netfilter.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Create /etc/sysctl.d/10-bridge.conf.</p> <pre><code># Do not filter packets crossing a bridge\nnet.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0\nnet.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0\nnet.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0\n</code></pre> <p>Apply and check the config.</p> <pre><code>sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/10-bridge.conf\nsudo sysctl -a | grep \"bridge-nf-call\"\n</code></pre> <p>Configure the guest to use host-bridge. Open up the Virtual Machine Manager and then select the target guest. Go to the NIC device. The drop down for \"Network Source\" should now include a device called \"Virtual netowrk 'host-bridge'\". The \"Bridge network device model\" will be \"virtio\" if that's your KVM configuration's default. Select that \"host-bridge\" device.</p> <p>Useful commands:</p> <p>A command to set automatic start of VMs when host boots up.</p> <pre><code>virsh autostart &lt;vm-name&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>A command to undo automatic start of VMs when host boots up.</p> <pre><code>virsh autostart --disable &lt;vm-name&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>A command to set automatic start of the Docker containers when host boots up.</p> <pre><code>docker update --restart unless-stopped &lt;container-name&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>A command to undo automatic start of the Docker containers when host boots up.</p> <pre><code>docker update --restart no &lt;container_name_or_id&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Alternative to <code>iptables</code> could be <code>nginx</code></p> <p>It is possible to configure <code>nginx</code> as a reverse proxy server on a host machine. That way, all traffic could be forwarded to an appropriate guest machine. Furthermore, using OpenResty with Lua, it is possible to configure it to pull forwarding rules from a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. Building on top, a FastAPI server would update the rules via a simple REST API endpoint. At the end, a user-oriented web application could be developed using Rest.js, Vue.js, or AngularJS. That would constitute a fully automated user-friendly system for host-guest VM management.</p> <p>References: * Guide to add a bridge interface to the Ubuntu desktop using nmcli * Another guide to add a bridge interface that helped to understand how to set dynamic IP instead of static * Guide to setup a bridged network for KVM guests * Another useful guide, this is where I started my research from * 1/3 of QEMU/KVM Ubuntu 24.04 installation instructions I used * 2/3 of QEMU/KVM Ubuntu 24.04 installation instructions I used * 3/3 of QEMU/KVM Ubuntu 24.04 installation instructions I used * 1/3 of port forwarding instructions I used * 2/3 of port forwarding instructions I used * 3/3 of port forwarding instructions I used * 1/2 of setting static IP using netplan and NetworkManager * 2/2 of setting static IP using netplan and NetworkManager</p>"},{"location":"manual/#gpu-passthrough","title":"GPU Passthrough","text":"<p>I decided to make it into a separate section because this task is complex enough on its own.</p> <p>The following command can tell what kernel driver is in use.</p> <pre><code>lspci | grep ' VGA ' | cut -d\" \" -f 1 | xargs -i lspci -v -s {}\n</code></pre> <p>The output should look something like this.</p> <pre><code>bd:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GA102GL [RTX A6000] (rev a1) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n    Subsystem: NVIDIA Corporation GA102GL [RTX A6000]\n    Physical Slot: 7\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 439, NUMA node 1, IOMMU group 30\n    Memory at e9000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]\n    Memory at 22bfe0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]\n    Memory at 22bff0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=32M]\n    I/O ports at d000 [size=128]\n    Expansion ROM at ea000000 [virtual] [disabled] [size=512K]\n    Capabilities: &lt;access denied&gt;\n    Kernel driver in use: nvidia\n    Kernel modules: nvidiafb, nouveau, nvidia_drm, nvidia\n</code></pre> <p>For a successful GPU passthrough, I installed Ubuntu 24.04.1 without NVIDIA drivers using only nouveau.</p> <p>Modify grub.</p> <pre><code>sudo nvim /etc/default/grub\n</code></pre> <p>Make it look like this.</p> <pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash intel_iommu=on iommu=pt\"\n</code></pre> <p>Save the changes, and update grub to apply the changes.
